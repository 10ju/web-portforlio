      <p>This game is an escape or survive game that you have to try to survive as long as possible to try and get a high score. This was made with Scratch and isn't the best thing in the world. Just move your mouse away from the lightning bolts and hope you can surive for a long time.</p>

      <h2>Python Drawing App</h2>
      <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/pinkDog2335">Link to Drawing  App</a></p>
      <p>This drawing app was coded completely in python and allows you to make simple drawings. However the performance gets low after you draw for a while. You can press "b" to change background to light blue, "t" to change background to teal, and "w" to change the background back to white. Pressing "1" just erases the drawing.</p>

      <p>This is a python "pong" game made in "Genius Hour". The game is extremely simple and has some bugs, but is completely functional for 2 players. Player 1 uses WASD as controls and Player 2 uses IJKL.</p>
